Arctic Monkeys aren't the band I think of when I think of technical musical excellence. They aren't who I turn to when I recommend
new music to someone. I can't even jokingly say that they're the best musical act in the world. But when someone asks what my
favorite band is, the loveable lads from Sheffield are far and away my only answer.

The reason they're clear in this regard lies in the variety of their discography. I can associate an album with a specific mood
I'm in or would like to be in, and I know that album will deliver (I only have seven moods for the seven albums, which is quite convenient).
Each album is distinct in its music, lyrics, and in frontman Alex Turner's singing style. Comparing their 2006 debut album,
_Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not_ (WPSIATWIN rolls off the tongue more, but let's call it _Whatever_) to their latest,
_The Car_, released in 2022, it's hard to guess how they got from point A to point B if you didn't know the steps taken in between.

Starting with these two, I'm running through my feelings on each of the band's seven albums, rambling on until I find within
myself what my favorite album is. You might be thinking, "Why would I want to find out this geek's favorite album is? Why _Do I Wanna Know?_.
I don't really care at all!" Well if you think I have the answer to your thoughts, _That's Where You're Wrong_.

This is going to be very tough considering I don't know how to describe music at all, but we'll give it the old college try.

<br />

The frenetic, pub-thrashing, club-roaming energy of **_Whatever_** took over the Internet and England by storm. It's a strong
contender for My Favorite Arctic Monkeys Album purely from the number of absolute bangers. _Dancefloor_ is so good that it has a
[funk cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7e66ZmGd4), and everyone knows only all-time classics are ever funk-covered.

_Fake Tales_ has the "practising their lines" line, so that's a classic. _Dancing Shoes_ brings up the notion of a "sexy little swine":
classic Turner. _Mardy Bum_ and _When The Sun Goes Down_ I'm pretty sure are sung by drunk people on the streets of England,
which can only make it a classic. And the album's closer, _A Certain Romance_, is definitely a classic and my favorite off
the album since it was what initially hooked me in to the band.

The album does have some instant skips for me and this isn't my favorite version of Alex Turner's singing, but it's undoubtedly
strong in every other aspect. Is _Whatever_ my favorite album though?

<br />

From old to new, **_The Car_** is a nice aural contrast to _Whatever_, but perhaps not for the best. I imagine many people after finishing
the album were left disappointed and yearning for the earlier sound of the band. I think it helps to think of the album
as a soundtrack to an old Italian spy movie, which is sometimes exactly what I want (it being one of my seven moods), but
understandably not for everyone.

The first two singles released, the beautiful, piano-led, string-accompanied _Mirrorball_, and _Body Paint_ which ends with the
closest resemblance of the old Monkeys we've had for a while, gave me a lot of hope for the album. However, listening to the
album revealed that those singles are probably as good as it gets for me. Besides the surprise packages of the
funklinked _I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am_ and the heavy _Sculptures of Anything Goes_, the album is pretty consistent... to
a fault. With no discernible peak and trough, the album loses my interest after the first half.

I love the string sections and Turner's ballad-singing voice on this album, but the lack of bangers and a non-interesting
lyrical theme means that _The Car_ is definitely NOT my favorite Arctic Monkeys album (unless I want to feel like I'm in an
Italian spy movie, which is at least once a week).

<br />

The band's successor to _Whatever_, **_Favorite Worst Nightmare_**, definitely falls in the space people talk about when
they mention missing the "old" Arctic Monkeys. Matching the energy of their debut album while adding a bit of rhythmic variety
(what??), _FWN_ is up in the hall of fame of great sequels, along with the likes of Spider-man 2, Shrek 2, and Attack of the Clones.

_FWN_'s contribution to the band's banger list and live act setlist is significant. _Brianstorm_ has to be the most frantic
hype-up of a man named "Brian" of all time. _Fluorescent Adolescent_ perfectly combines the young geezer aura of Turner's lyrics
with a melancholic, upbeat sound, creating an undisputed classic in the band's discography.

It's not a standout in everyone's eyes, but _Only Ones Who Know_ is definitely a highlight for me, invoking a very specific emotion
which feels like a mixture of sadness, puppy love, and nostalgia. I'm unsure why, but I return to the track's guitar twangs quite often.
Then, just like _Whatever_, the album closes with a track which has an imprint on rock music itself, such is its brilliance. _505_
is arguably the band's magnum opus. Certainly at the time it was, before _Do I Wanna Know?_ showed up. The track is perfection,
including its slow-start-explosive-finish tempo, beautiful lyrical theme ("frightened by the bite, no it's no harsher than the bark" - get out of here),
and Turner's singing range and execution. _505_ is a musical masterpiece worthy of everyone's ears.

_Favorite Worst Nightmare_ is a progression of _Whatever_, but for me, it's filled with even more clunkers and songs I flat
out hate (I'm looking at you "Old Yellow Bricks" ðŸ‘€). There might be more skips than listens on the album for me, but do
the bangers carry the album to the title of My Favorite Arctic Monkeys album? Perhaps.

<br />

A challenger to _505_'s GOAT status and the track which elevated the band to about the heights they're at now is _Do I Wanna Know?_.
If you've heard of the Arctic Monkeys, you've probably heard of it, and you've probably seen the iconic album art of **_AM_**,
the band's fifth album released in 2013.

_AM_ made the band a household name while also transcending their image from renowned Brit musicians to Hollywood rock stars.
The dark, booming baselines and hints of R&B make you feel like you're slowly walking into a smokey club with the lads, sunglasses
on, hair slicked. The album's vibe doesn't deviate as much as the band's other albums, with _No. 1 Party Anthem_, which I quite like,
and _Mad Sounds_ serving as an interlude to the generally heavy, cool as hell mood.

A lot of the bangers on the album are almost overplayed for me at this point, including _Do I Wanna Know?_, _R U Mine?_,
and _Why'd You Only Call_. Undoubtedly attractive songs, they've been capitalized on too much for me to consider them
favorites of mine. But the bangers definitely end at those three. _Arabella_ continues the theme of music exactly suitable
for feeling cool while walking down the street. _Fireside_ perfectly encapsulates how Turner's singing on the album lifts
its music from great rock songs to very singable great rock songs. Possibly my favorite track on the album, _Knee Socks_,
has a ridiculous guitar sound that sounds even better in my head when I try to mimic it with just my mouth. The singability
of the song is at a very high level, even when you're trying to cover Turner's voice and Josh Homme's backing vocals simultaneously.

It's hard to deny that _AM_ is expertly produced, lyrically excellent, and features _this_ version of Alex Turner's best singing.
The album has a lot of incredible tracks and a lot of the band's most famous tracks. With all that said, it's an album I don't
listen to as much as others. It could be the specific mood of the album or due to the overplayed nature of the songs. Despite this, could
it be My Favorite Arctic Monkeys Album?

<br />

_AM_ sort of produced a split in the Arctic Monkeys fanbase. There were those who grew up with them from the start, listening
to them evolve over time, and seeing _AM_ as the next iteration. There were the many new fans, drawn in by the ultra-popular
tracks. Then there were those who didn't like the direction taken in _AM_ and who missed the humble Sheffield act's image
pre-stardom.

**_Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino_** caused another split. _AM_ was always going to be a tough act to follow, but the stylistic
change taken in _TBHC_ seemingly lost many of the new fans brought in by _AM_ as well as the OG fans. It's a divisive album,
but the bold step taken away from the catchy, cool tunes of _AM_ and toward the sci-fi lunar lounge vibe of its successor
was one taken with aplomb.

The album is a grower. Very few tracks stood out on my first few listens, with the main highlight being _Four Out Of Five_.
The first single to be released, _Four Out Of Five_ is a synthy, grandiose telling of the album's fictional setting - a
lavish hotel set on the moon in the not-too-distant future, or at least the taquerÃ­a on the hotel roof.

The track represents the album with pride and sits square in the middle of the album. and the tracks that come before it seems to build up to it.
_Star Treatment_ launches the rocket moonwards and sets the tone theme-wise and, especially, lyric-wise. _TBHC_ features my
favorite writing of Turner's, from vivid moon-hotel scenery description, to lines such as "What do you mean you've never seen
Blade Runner?". The first half of the album continues the futuristic, synthy vibe. A highlight for me is oddly _Golden Trunks_, particularly
the point at which the song changes key near the end. The song goes from what seems to be another filler track to a glorious,
powerful cameo of orchestral magic.

The second half of the album isn't everyone's favorite, but I do like the spooky, Frankenstein's lab vibe of _Science Fiction_.
The album ends with two of my favorites. The casino elevator flow of _Batphone_ shows off Turner's vocal range and foreshadows
the type of singing he does in _The Car_. _The Ultracheese_ is a wholesome end to the album, delivering an image of Turner and the
band sitting in a fancy but empty piano bar - Turner singing to himself.

_Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino_ might actually be My Favorite Arctic Monkeys Album. The lyrics, singing, and ritzy space-opera
aesthetic consistently hooks me in. Although there are very few bangers and a few skips, I love the album due to the cohesion
of all its elements.

<br />

_TBHC_ was one of the band's many stylistic veer-lefts, but the first big change came from _Favorite Worst Nightmare_'s successor,
**_Humbug_**. The album's gloomy, emo atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the at times bombastic, pure-rock _FWN_. Long-hair Alex Turner
was out in full force. _Humbug_'s tone is immediately set by the album opener, _My Propeller_. I like how the song sort of sounds
like a helicopter propeller, which I guess was their intention (although the subject of the message involves a whole different
kind of helicopter). The album's most popular song is probably _Crying Lightning_, named after an apparent alternative version
of "the boy who cried wolf", where cries of seeing lightning in the distance affected ice-cream van drivers, who wouldn't be
able to sell ice-cream in the rain... Britain is a weird place.

The tone of album rarely waivers from its gloom and wistfulness. _Secret Door_'s melancholic feeling is amplified by the guitar
twangs frolicking and fucking about. The imagery described in _Fire and The Thud_ about having someone on one's mind non-stop
is vivid and personally, pretty accurate. _Dance Little Liar_'s delving into the whole experience of being a liar is peak Turner.
My favorite track from the album has to be _Cornerstone_. One of the more uplifting-_sounding_ songs with a seemingly bleak
message, _Cornerstone_'s simple strong structure, lyrics, and looking-into-your-soul singing from Turner makes it among my
top 3 favorite songs from the band.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIQz6zZi7R0" title="Arctic Monkeys - Cornerstone (Official Video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

_Humbug_'s laid-back, cool emo guy theme isn't something I find myself diving into often, but when I do, the album hits the spot.
A few of the songs sound a bit too same-y for me, but the consistency of the quality of writing and the existence of _Cornerstone_
means the album very well could be My Favorite Arctic Monkeys Album... Or could it?

<br />

The final album to cover features the beachy, lustful tracks of **_Suck it and See_**. Another big change of direction following
_Humbug_, _SIAS_ stops the wallowing and, based on the title, starts the ~swallowing~ exploration of being completely lovestruck.
Whereas _Humbug_ feels like sitting in a dark room while it's raining, hair and eyeshadow covering your eyes, _SIAS_ takes a
brighter, day-out-at-the-carnival type of outlook to the wrinkles and folds of love.

With a few exceptions, the tracks on _SIAS_ make you think Turner was in an especially good mood while working out the album.
_Brick By Brick_ may be the band's most meme-inducing song of their discography. It's hard to deny the intricacies of the track's
lyrics, particularly when the concept of "bricks" is brought up. _Don't Sit Down_ is another outlier in terms of the general
mood of the album, describing various dangerous activities. It's responsible for possibly [the best direct interpretation of lyrics](https://youtu.be/eW6N-POf3yo?t=107)
Turner has produced on stage. _Piledriver Waltz_ gives off big Christmas energy and is another good example of how Turner's
singing style makes a lot of the band's songs fun to sing.

Almost every other song outside of those three blend into one for me, which speaks to how the band has doubled down on stylistic
changes over the years, a pattern which has continued to this day. The album could easily be used to soundtrack a romcom film.
_Reckless Serenade_ would play when the main guy first lays his eyes on the main girl walking down the street. During a montage of
the couple driving around in a cabriolet playing pranks on the local town, you know _Black Treacle_ is playing on the car radio.
One of the most upbeat tracks the band has produced, _The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala_ is what plays when the couple are holding
hands spinning around in a meadow. _Love is a Laserquest_ (a fantastic title by the way, although I have no idea what a laserquest is)
is what plays when the girl agrees to get married to the movie antagonist (who is actually still a decent guy) and the main guy
is in tatters. Finally, _That's Where You're Wrong_ plays during the main guy's rush to the wedding to win the girl back

_Suck It and See_ is almost always consumed in its entirety by me. The spreading out of the darker songs in between the
many romantic songs makes the pacing of the album great, much like how the better songs are spaced out in between the more
average songs. Much like _Humbug_, the album is exactly what the doctor ordered for the specific mood it tries to convey,
but I prefer the sweet, punchy medicine provided by _SIAS_ over _Humbug_'s heavy cough syrup. Does this make _SIAS_, officially,
My Favorite Arctic Monkeys Album...?

<br />

Well, no. As mentioned at the start of the post, the reason the Arctic Monkeys are all my seasons is because of its coverage
of so many types of feelings and themes. This naturally makes My Favorite Arctic Monkeys Album dependent on the weather.
While _The Car_ is yet to reach a point at which I'll gladly give it a spin out of nowhere, the band's discography is so great
because it's quite easy to select an album if I'm randomly picking one out. The right album always makes itself know at the
right time.

So, the concluding question: Is _Whatever_, _Favorite Worst Nightmare_, _Humbug_, _Suck It and See_, _AM_, or _TBHC_, decisively,
without question, My Favorite Arctic Monkeys Album?

Yes.
