# Stray

_Stray_ is an "indie" game that I had my eye on since it was announced in 2020. It's published by Annapurna Interactive,
who have amassed a very impressive [collection](https://annapurnainteractive.com/en) of games from small developer studios who
produce colorful and interesting (gameplay-wise) works with stories which stray from the usual AAA settings.

The draw of _Stray_ for me came from the neon-lit, dystopian streets of the robot-inhabited city - an aesthetic that I'm
always down to clown with. But pairing that with the ability to traverse these streets as a little ginger cat? I moved from
impatiently tapping my credit card on Annapurna's table to shoving it down their throat. From viewing the promotional art of
the game, it's very clear that this cat, who actually goes unnamed, is the focal point and POV of the game. It's therefore
very difficult for me to be writing this without bring up any cat puns. Fortunately/unfortunately, that ends meow.

Story and vibes (spoiler-free)

Although The Cat is the playable character of _Stray_, the game's main character setting-wise is the forgotten cyberpunk city
through which you scamper. Scratching around, trying to figure out what exactly is going on in this

Not enough has been said about Fromsoft's _Elden Ring (2022)_. It hasn't received enough [awards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/04/elden-ring-just-passed-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-total-game-of-the-year-awards/?sh=4650588c33e8),
enough [playtime](https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-stats-most-played-2022-fromsoft-quit-malenia-1849932520), nor enough [attempts at finishing the game via a dancepad](https://screenrant.com/elden-ring-weird-boss-challenge-runs-controllers-mods/).
Luckily, I'm here to report on what little analysis I can scrounge up from my experience of the game. In short,
it is immense.

In long, apart from all the usual Soulsborne shenanigans the game contains, it's the open-world addition
to the Fromsoft formula that impressed me the most. The game map (among other things) is ever-expanding in a
way that fools you into initially thinking it's a fraction of its final size. The regions in the game are
distinct in look and terrain, and each, between the crinkles and folds of the landscape, hide dozens of
catacombs, ruins, and pathways to an entire underworld.

Despite the size of the world, exploring never really felt overwhelming, in part due to me being a bit of
an exploration expert, but mostly due to the design of the map. While the handful of main regions in The Lands
Between are long, wide, and deep, the regions are pieced together in a relatively linear fashion. Starting
at Limgrave, you can go south to the Weeping Peninsula or east to Caelid (if you're into suffering), but
from there, you travel mostly northwards for the rest of the game. Some devious chests and portals throw
you to the other side of the map, and the underground section feels rather disconnected from the overworld,
but for the most part, heading north and towards the Erdtree means you'll never be _completely_ lost.
~~I desperately need an Erdtree in my own life.~~

_Elden Ring's_ perfect open-world implementation is the Chemical X to the Soulsborne formula. With Fromsoft's
other games, progressing through the world is akin to a detective solving a (violent, unforgiving, and painful)
murder mystery. At first, there's a natural lead to follow which will eventually end in a boss room. Once
that is taken care of, two more leads appear: one is a simpler path taking you to another clue, but the other
lead takes you to a spell-wielding boss duo that you are hopelessly under-leveled and under-skilled for.
So you uncover more clues and follow more leads until you return to that boss duo, which is now a walk in
the park (assuming all your walks in the park are sweaty, infuriatingly difficult, and involve you saying
"I can't do this" non-stop). Ultimately, once the main leads are tied up, you face the final boss and
solve the mystery, being rewarded with the end credits.

The point of this contrived, shambolic metaphor is this: _Dark Souls_, _Bloodborne_, and _Sekiro_ each
follow this formula, where if you get stuck at a certain boss or area (_Sekiro's_ Guardian Ape comes to mind), there's
usually one or two other places you can explore and level up to help you return to and get past that area.
_Elden Ring_ dials this up to 11, ensuring you've got four or five avenues to stroll through across the world if
you're at a bottleneck. It is difficult to get hard-stuck in the game provided you ‚ú®explore‚ú®.

Within the open world, _Elden Ring's_ execution of combat, build variety, and resource acquisition
is the perfect calabash of Soulsborne elements mastered over time. The main story, dialogue, and lore
is as epic and nonsensical as expected, decipherable only through a blessed [Vaati Vidya](https://youtu.be/DYDs_Inzkz4) drop.
Some side stories and characters, like [Jar Bairn](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jar+Bairn) and [Brother Corhyn's](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn) questlines
are among my favorite in all of Fromsoft's catalog. Just don't ask me to explain them.

The game's art direction is most similar to _Dark Souls 3_, with an added edge of vibrancy coming from the
ever-present golds of the Erdtree, the oppressive red skies of Caelid, and the star-lit purple backsplash
of the underground section. As always, there is a synergy between the world design and the environment art. From the
moment you step out of the tutorial cave, you can see everything north from Limgrave to the Altus Plateau, even
the Forge of the Giants, all within eventual reach. After Stormveil castle, you'll approach a perch perfectly
framing Liurnia and its towering landmarks. The most prominent landmark, the Raya Lucaria Academy, looks mythical
from afar, and majestically magical once you step inside. You might hear the kids say: "It's giving Hogwarts üòç."
It's giving Hogwarts a run for its money, for sure.

The game is not without a few issues. I found the repetition and re-skinning of almost all enemies and
bosses quite disappointing. I get that for the scale of the world and quantity of content, some efficient
re-use of entities is a necessity, but there was a 40-hour stretch in my playthough in which I didn't
find a brand-new enemy or boss. Sure, I don't mind fighting another dragon diagnosed with scarlet rot,
but I draw the line at fighting TWO mad pumpkin heads.

With the amount of content, progression of your character feels natural and constant, even in the latter
stages of the game. However, my second issue is related to this and feeling way too overpowered. I managed
to beat most of the final main story bosses on my first attempts (starting with Malekith), making
the closing run feel a bit anti-climactic. I didn't feel like I had to be perfect and learn their patterns
to do it either, I just used the same skillset picked up over the course of 200 hours backed by the
buffs and stats garnered over that time. It certainly helped that I played on easy mode with an Int/Magic
build and usage of summons, but it should not have been that easy. Of course, a detour leading to Malenia
ended up in expected and endless humiliation, and that contributed to the final few bosses feeling
undercooked.

_Elden Ring_ has deservedly been in the conversation of GOAT video game. It offers plenty of exploration,
combat, lore, and build variety, and it nails pretty much every one of those aspects. Personally, the scope
of the game inevitably leads to some flaws, but the game still comes as close to perfection as you can get
in multiple genres, including its own Souls-like genre.

# Death's Door

* Screenshots from [IGN Nordic](https://nordic.ign.com/deaths-door/48202/gallery/deaths-door-screenshots?p=1)

![Death's Door screenshot of a bird standing on a cliff in front of a larger bird with a tall door behind it](/images/20230226/deaths-door-1.webp)

A lot of things about _Death's Door_ screams "indie game". The witty, slightly dark, text-based dialog, the delightful
3D art style, and the fact that it's published by Devolver Digital, one of the biggest names in the "indie"
games industry.

<br />

Stay tuned for Part 2!
