As the title suggests, this post is going to run through all the games I've played in the financial year
currently ending (March 2022 to February 2023). You might ask, "What significance does the
financial year have to video games some random guy has played? Surely that's irrelevant unless we have some
sorta video game accountant over here?"

Firstly, leave me alone, bully. Secondly, no, there's no significance.
I planned to write a similar list for just 2022, but due to factors out of my control, namely, laziness,
lack of motivation, and inability to write, I delayed the piece to now.

Let's get into it with a game you might have heard of...

# Elden Ring

![Elden Ring screenshot in which a character is overlooking a sunlit horizon with some buildings and a golden tree ahead](/images/20230226/elden-ring-1.jpg)

Not enough has been said about Fromsoft's _Elden Ring (2022)_. It hasn't received enough [awards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/04/elden-ring-just-passed-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-total-game-of-the-year-awards/?sh=4650588c33e8),
enough [playtime](https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-stats-most-played-2022-fromsoft-quit-malenia-1849932520), nor enough [attempts at finishing the game via a dancepad](https://screenrant.com/elden-ring-weird-boss-challenge-runs-controllers-mods/).
Luckily, I'm here to report on what little analysis I can scrounge up from my experience of the game. In short,
it is immense.

In long, apart from all the usual Soulsborne shenanigans the game contains, it's the open-world addition
to the Fromsoft formula that impressed me the most. The game map (among other things) is ever-expanding in a
way that fools you into initially thinking it's a fraction of its final size. The regions in the game are
distinct in look and terrain, and each, between the crinkles and folds of the landscape, hide dozens of
catacombs, ruins, and pathways to an entire underworld.

Despite the size of the world, exploring never really felt overwhelming, in part due to me being a bit of
an exploration expert, but mostly due to the design of the map. While the handful of main regions in The Lands
Between are long, wide, and deep, the regions are pieced together in a relatively linear fashion. Starting
at Limgrave, you can go south to the Weeping Peninsula or east to Caelid (if you're into suffering), but
from there, you travel mostly northwards for the rest of the game. Some devious chests and portals throw
you to the other side of the map, and the underground section feels rather disconnected from the overworld,
but for the most part, heading north and towards the Erdtree means you'll never be _completely_ lost.
~~I desperately need an Erdtree in my own life.~~

_Elden Ring's_ perfect open-world implementation is the Chemical X to the Soulsborne formula. With Fromsoft's
other games, progressing through the world is akin to a detective solving a (violent, unforgiving, and painful)
murder mystery. At first, there's a natural lead to follow which will eventually end in a boss room. Once
that is taken care of, two more leads appear: one is a simpler path taking you to another clue, but the other
lead takes you to a spell-wielding boss duo that you are hopelessly under-leveled and under-skilled for.
So you uncover more clues and follow more leads until you return to that boss duo, which is now a walk in
the park (assuming all your walks in the park are sweaty, infuriatingly difficult, and involve you saying
"I can't do this" non-stop). Ultimately, once the main leads are tied up, you face the final boss and
solve the mystery, being rewarded with the end credits.

The point of this contrived, shambolic metaphor is this: _Dark Souls_, _Bloodborne_, and _Sekiro_ each
follow this formula, where if you get stuck at a certain boss or area (_Sekiro's_ Guardian Ape comes to mind), there's
usually one or two other places you can explore and level up to help you return to and get past that area.
_Elden Ring_ dials this up to 11, ensuring you've got four or five avenues to stroll through across the world if
you're at a bottleneck. It is difficult to get hard-stuck in the game provided you ‚ú®explore‚ú®.

![An Elden Ring dog is stood in front of a player-written message](/images/20230226/elden-ring-dog.jpg)

Within the open world, _Elden Ring's_ execution of combat, build variety, and resource acquisition
is the perfect calabash of Soulsborne elements mastered over time. The main story, dialogue, and lore
is as epic and nonsensical as expected, decipherable only through a blessed [Vaati Vidya](https://youtu.be/DYDs_Inzkz4) drop.
Some side stories and characters, like [Jar Bairn](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jar+Bairn) and [Brother Corhyn's](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn) questlines
are among my favorite in all of Fromsoft's catalog. Just don't ask me to explain them.

The game's art direction is most similar to _Dark Souls 3_, with an added edge of vibrancy coming from the
ever-present golds of the Erdtree, the oppressive red skies of Caelid, and the star-lit purple backsplash
of the underground section. As always, there is a synergy between the world design and the environment art. From the
moment you step out of the tutorial cave, you can see everything north from Limgrave to the Altus Plateau, even
the Forge of the Giants, all within eventual reach. After Stormveil castle, you'll approach a perch perfectly
framing Liurnia and its towering landmarks. The most prominent landmark, the Raya Lucaria Academy, looks mythical
from afar, and majestically magical once you step inside. You might hear the kids say: "It's giving Hogwarts üòç."
It's giving Hogwarts a run for its money, for sure.

![Elden Ring screenshot in which a character is overlooking a forest hill with some windmills silhouetted by a yellow sky](/images/20230226/elden-ring-3.jpg)

The game is not without a few issues. I found the repetition and re-skinning of almost all enemies and
bosses quite disappointing. I get that for the scale of the world and quantity of content, some efficient
re-use of entities is a necessity, but there was a 40-hour stretch in my playthough in which I didn't
find a brand-new enemy or boss. Sure, I don't mind fighting another dragon diagnosed with scarlet rot,
but I draw the line at fighting TWO mad pumpkin heads.

With the amount of content, progression of your character feels natural and constant, even in the latter
stages of the game. However, my second issue is related to this and feeling way too overpowered. I managed
to beat most of the final main story bosses on my first attempts (starting with Malekith), making
the closing run feel a bit anti-climactic. I didn't feel like I had to be perfect and learn their patterns
to do it either, I just used the same skillset picked up over the course of 200 hours backed by the
buffs and stats garnered over that time. It certainly helped that I played on easy mode with an Int/Magic
build and usage of summons, but it should not have been that easy. Of course, a detour leading to Malenia
ended up in expected and endless humiliation, and that contributed to the final few bosses feeling
undercooked.

_Elden Ring_ has deservedly been in the conversation of GOAT video game. It offers plenty of exploration,
combat, lore, and build variety, and it nails pretty much every one of those aspects. Personally, the scope
of the game inevitably leads to some flaws, but the game still comes as close to perfection as you can get
in multiple genres, including its own Souls-like genre.

# Death's Door

* Screenshots from [IGN Nordic](https://nordic.ign.com/deaths-door/48202/gallery/deaths-door-screenshots?p=1)

![Death's Door screenshot of a bird standing on a cliff in front of a larger bird with a tall door behind it](/images/20230226/deaths-door-1.webp)

A lot of things about _Death's Door_ screams "indie game". The witty, slightly dark, text-based dialog, the delightful
3D art style, and the fact that it's published by Devolver Digital, one of the biggest names in the "indie"
games industry.

The action-adventure gameplay and level-design, similar to games like Hollow Knight and Hyper Light Drifter,
has initial simplicity with scaling complexity and challenge as the combat system and world opens up.
It's another **good** execution of the Metroidvania and Souls-lite genre. And yet, I was yearning for something
even better. Slightly more interesting combat, slightly more areas to explore, and slightly more characters
to get to know.

I absolutely commend the game for offering what it does, for creating a unique and captivating atmosphere,
for perfecting its simple yet challenging gameplay loop, and for offering a variety of regions which each
thematically marry wonderful environmental art with memorable narratives and NPCs (shout out to Pothead).
And yet, I was yearning for something even better.

![Death's Door screenshot of a bird in an autumn-themed garden standing in front of Pothead](/images/20230226/deaths-door-4.webp)

However, I don't think Acid Nerve, the game's developers, with their presumably finite resources and
realistic scope, should be responsible for making _Death's Door_ even bigger and better. AAA action-adventure
developers have the resources to take the ideas dug up from the gameplay innovation depths reached every year
by the indie developer scene and turn them into novel, interesting **AAA** games.

Yet, with a few exceptions, resources are always poured into the same old ingredients: bland,
high-fidelity graphics, vast open worlds littered with tedious tasks, and repetitive combat and traversal.
Why?? Is it to minimize the risk of new or existing IP releases tanking upon straying from the beaten
path? Is it an ignorance towards what games like _Death's Door_, _Hollow Knight_, and _Outer Wilds_ can
achieve? Will we ever see a Souls-like with a non-photorealistic art style and a top-down perspective
being made by one of Ubisoft or Sony's big studios, or is that just a waste of resources? For now, I'm
thankful that the mindless splendour of big AAA adventure games make for perfect podcast vehicles, while
being on the lookout for the next memorable, heart-filled, and awe-inspiring indie classic.

![Death's Door screenshot of a bird standing on a snow-covered stone platform in front of a big door](/images/20230226/deaths-door-3.webp)

Although it is only an iteration on the indie Souls-lite/Metroidvania formula, The combat, writing, world
design, and puzzles of _Death's Door_ make it very easy to recommend to anyone wanting an alternative
to hiding in bandit camp bushes in Assassin's Creed.

# Deathloop

* Screenshots from [Push Square](https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/deathloop/screenshots)

![Scene from Deathloop in which a man with a gun is taking cover in a casino](/images/20230226/deathloop-1.webp)

Arkane Studios' immersive-sims consistently nail it. The _Dishonored_ franchise, _Prey_,
and 2021's _Deathloop_ are all finely-polished, critically-acclaimed pieces of video game art. The studio's
execution of supernatural-stealth-sandbox-shooter gameplay, distinct art styles, and fresh, interesting settings are
prevalent throughout their games, and they are extremely good at what they do.

For these reasons, their games have always _seemed_ appealing to me. However, mysteriously, for each of the
main games (besides Prey), I start the game, begin figuring out the systems and the world layouts, enjoy myself quite a bit,
but end up abandoning it without thought a month later. It happened twice with _Dishonored_, once with _Dishonored 2_,
and twice again with _Deathloop_.

_What could be the problem?_

In the case of _Deathloop_, it could be the number of complex systems you have to keep in mind. I am trying to
sneak up on some fellas before realizing it's not the right place or time of day to do that?? Why is there
suddenly a Dark Souls invader in my single-player game?? How can I possibly remember all these people's
daily routines??

It could be the overwhelming offering of choice in how you do things and where you go to do them.
In the _Dishonoreds_ and _Deathloop_, you can explore each region to your heart's content (and you probably
should), but there's usually a single target destination. How you get there and how you kill enemies in
your way is usually up to you. This can be very fun. I often try to set up a path of stealth, perfectly
platforming on and through various apartments blocks while picking off the opps, and equally often,
I mess up a kill or make too much noise and end up guns blazing through the street like a headless chicken
(with a gun). Individually, the stealth aspect and gunplay aspect of these games are very satisfying,
and I wonder if separating these aspects into different parts of the gameplay loop (like the Arkham games do),
would make each aspect feel even better.

![Screenshot from Deathloop where a first person perspective is taken of a man throwing magical purple orbs while carrying a gun](/images/20230226/deathloop-2.webp)

But perhaps I'm the problem. Perhaps stealth is just not for me. Perhaps it's hard to re-immerse myself
into an environment and game style a week after entering it without buying into it fully in the first place.
Perhaps it's those damn filthy _Dishonored_ rats.

_Deathloop_ offers a myriad of colorful environments, characters, and gameplay tools alongside an interesting time-loop
premise. But it's another Arkane game that will remain unfinished for me.

# PowerWash Simulator

Look, sometimes you just need a good podcast game: A vehicle which can transport you from the start of your
favorite podcast to the end (and if there's enough gas in the tank, another three podcasts). As someone
who consumes podcasts more than any other media, this type of game is a staple in my weekly game rotation.
A good podcast game allows you to enjoy a podcast while not feeling like you're pouring unnecessary brain
juice into a game that possibly doesn't deserve all your brain juice. A bad podcast game ruins the podcast
and the game.

My favorite games, fondest gaming memories, and fondest podcast memories have often come from combining
these two mediums. My favorite game of all time, _Breath of the Wild_, is special to me because I can remember
exactly where I was while listening to parts of maybe my favorite podcast of all time, _[U Talkin' U2 To Me?](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/from-boy-to-under-a-blood-red-sky-u-talkin-u2-to-me/)_.
Hiking up to Goron City while listening to the bros playing musical tricks on [Todd Glass](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/staind-glass-u-talkin-u2-to-me/) - unforgettable.
Plowing through the snowy mountains of the Gerudo Highlands while The Scotts and company [commentate](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/commentary-special-u-talkin-u2-to-me/) their
own pilot episode - untouchable vibe-wise. _Breath of the Wild_ might be my favorite game of all time _because_
it is the perfect podcast game.

So what makes a good podcast game?

- It should be pretty mindless. Any aspect of a game which requires you to use the half of the brain currently
processing the complex audio frequencies being spat out from your podcast player is not going to translate
perfectly.
- Minimal speech, text, and audio cues. An obvious one - you can't process multiple streams of dialogue
at once like some under-fire manager at a press conference. Maybe the worst violators of this requirement are 
games with casual story exposition and narrative expansion during the off-time between action (I'm looking directly
in your torso-less eyes, Mimir üëÅ). You can always pause the pod if need be, which is something I do without guilt,
but if you're pausing and switching context too often, it's not ideal.
- Long game sessions. Open-world games are good examples of this because their gameplay loops have longer plateaus,
allowing for a good amount of uninterrupted podcast listening.

Some of the best podcast games I've played include a lot of open-world games, racing games, the Soulsbornes, and some
puzzle games like _Wilmot's Warehouse_. _Doom Eternal_ is also on the list because it meets criteria one
and two while being outrageously fun.

![Screenshot from PowerWash Simulator in which a dirty skate park is being overlooked from a first person perspective](/images/20230226/pws-2.jpg)


_PowerWash Simulator_ is a perfect podcast game. Extremely brainless, zero speech, almost zero text, just pure
dirt-removing fun. The game perfectly reconstructs the dopamine you receive when looking at foggy windows being wiped
or dusty floors being swept and delivers a healthy dose of it. It mixes things up with different nozzle types,
soap variants, and a variety of environments and surfaces to get down and clean on.

As you add to your power-washing arsenal, the maps in the game increase in scale to rise to the challenge.
You'll start off with simple vans and humble backyards before escalating to bigass treemansions and entire
amusement parks. The maps can definitely feel overwhelming if you're doing the job alone, but the game
does support co-op, enabling you to get wet and wacky with your best friends.

Regardless of the podcasts you're getting through, at some point, especially during the 2+ hour long maps, the
game does get boring. For me, that point was during the process of cleaning up an entire fire station.
I just paused and thought: "What am I doing with my life?". I quit the game immediately... But the thought persisted.

Stay tuned for Part 2!
